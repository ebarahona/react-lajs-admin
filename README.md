# Admin Dashboard

##### v0.0.1 

[Change Log](./CHANGELOG.md)


## Getting Started

### Installing packages

```
npm install
```

### Starting the server
##### For development:
```
npm run start:dev
```

##### For production:
```
npm start
```
Note that the bundle file dependency has to be changed to _/dist/bundle.js_ when running the version that is in 
development branch without dev server (which is not recommended).

Any version from master branch will have everything ready and 
set up for production use.
