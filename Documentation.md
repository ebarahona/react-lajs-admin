# Model configuration

Model configuration files folder: `common/model`.

Model json files serve two purposes â€“ server model configuration and customization of the basic view representation.

## View representation
Each property accepts a number of options that configure view representation.

| Option         | Default value                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

##### Constants representing input elements
Properties may optionally be configured to be represented by a number of existing or custom html elements.

| THUMB_RESIZE_INPUT    | Same as IMAGE_INPUT, additionally automatically resizes image to configured dimensions. |

##### Adding custom element
Custom elements can also be used as inputs.

1. Pass a string constant representing the custom element name as a new property to the object `Elements` in the file `config.js` under `client/src/configurableElements`.
2. Import the element into `elements.js` under `client/src/configurableElements/factories` and create a new option for the factory method that will return your element on the defined constant.
3. Use this constant as a value for `inputValue` property option.
